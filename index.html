                <h2>The COVID-19 Pandemic and its Impact on Mental Health</h2>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting impact on our lives, and one area that has been significantly impacted is our mental health. As we transition to a post-pandemic world, many people are still struggling with the aftermath of the pandemic. The prolonged stress and trauma of the pandemic have left many individuals with increased anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges. Moreover, the post-pandemic world comes with its own set of challenges, such as navigating social reintegration, adjusting to new work and school environments, and coping with the ongoing uncertainty of the future. As we move forward, it's important to prioritize our mental health and seek the support we need to navigate this new reality."</p>

				<p>When you are stressed, fearful, or uncomfortable, pause to think about what you are feeling and consider what is activating those feelings. Maybe talking to a friend about plans to go to the movies is making your stomach tighten, looking online for flights to see family after more than a year is making your head spin, or considering a return to the office is making you want to hit snooze on the alarm for a fourth time.</p>

				<h1>Practice mindfulness</h1>

			  <div class="flip-card-back">
				<p>When you’re stressed, the idea of meditating might seem impossible, but we know it can work. Start slow with breathing in a peaceful location, or sitting outside with a cup of tea (without scrolling through your phone!). Deep breathing, meditation, and mindful practices can train our brain to better manage stress.</p>

				<h1>Find support</h1>

			  <div class="flip-card-back">
				<p>You don’t have to suffer alone. Reach out to your network for support, whether it’s a friend, family member, a therapist, faith leader or a support group. It’s true that we are stronger together and opening up to talk about what we’re feeling and thinking can help.</p>
